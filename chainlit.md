## Features
🗃️ **Knowledge Base:** I have access to a local Chroma database. You can add new documents with the `/add <url>` command or view the last 25 documents added to the database with the `/kb` command.

🌐 **Retrieval-Augmented-Generation:** My specialty is synthesizing answers from your data sources. Just provide me with the data or URLs you want to explore, and I'll find relevant information and provide comprehensive insights.

🔍 **Supported Data Types:** You can share data in formats like CSV, PDF, JSON, YouTube videos, text, documentation websites, DOCX, MDX, Notion, sitemaps, web pages, XML, OpenAPI specs, Gand even data from databases like Postgres, MySQL, Slack messages, Discourse forums, Discord conversations, Substack articles, files from a local directory, Dropbox files, and Beehiv data.
